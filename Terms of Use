Terms of Use
Effective as of the installation of the application

The following Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply when you use the WallPix app (the “App”) or the service provided via the App (the “Service”), sometimes collectively referred to as the “App.” Please review these Terms carefully. By accessing or using the App, you show you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the App.

Paid Services

You may be able to make in-App purchases, in which case the fee is collected via Apple (our “Billing Service Provider”). We may also offer subscriptions, which can also be paid for via Apple. You will be required to provide the Company and/or its Billing Service Provider with information regarding your credit card or other payment method. You represent and warrant that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment method. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date). You hereby authorize the Company to bill you in accordance with the terms of your subscription plan until you terminate your account, and you agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges, you must notify the Company within thirty (30) days after the date that you are billed. You can terminate your use of the Service and otherwise manage your account using the App. We reserve the right to change the Company’s fees. If the Company does change its fees, the Company will provide notice of the change within the App. Your continued use of the App after the fee change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Certain subscription offerings may include a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from such a subscription before the Company starts charging your payment method, you must cancel the subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you will be responsible for payment for the full term of the subscription period. If you properly terminate your paid subscription, you will not be charged for future months (or other periods, as stated in the subscription terms). However, you will not receive a refund for an unused portion of a month (or other period) for which you have already paid. No refunds are offered for any products or services offered via the App. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ELECT TO PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWALS AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RECURRING CHARGES TO YOUR APPLICABLE PAYMENT BASED ON THIS AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU AND WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE RECURRING CHARGE MAY CHANGE IF APPLICABLE TAX RATES CHANGE OR IF THE FEES (INCLUDING OUR FEES AND CREDIT CARD HANDLING FEES) HAVE BEEN INCREASED.
